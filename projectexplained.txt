SecureSweBank

What to do:
The application will connect and use a database to save and manage information. 
All transactions must be saved and retrieved and deleted and updated to/from the database. 
There should also be an account system, with which you can log in to different users,
switch between them and add transactions. 
All the functionality that was in the assignment from the previous course should be available now,
but can be done per-user. One user can't see transactions for another user.

Clarification requirements for account systems, the following possibilities shall be available:
- Register users by name and password
- Log in by name and password
- Log out (and be able to switch users by logging in again)
- All functionality from previous task, linked per-user
